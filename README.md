# PWA Budget Tracker

## Description

Budget Tracker is an application that will help the user keep up with expenses. They can add funds, for any money aquired, or subtract, depending on purchases. A line graph is created, based on the data, that will illustrate spending and gaining patterns. The best feature is that the Budget Tracker can also be used offline. Data can still be gathered, but will not populate until the user is back online.

Budget Tracker is installed by first cloning the repo from [Edibozu](https://github.com/Edibozu/pwa-budget-tracker). Once cloned, the code can be viewed in VS Code. The application itself is deployed on [Heroku](https://pwa-budget-tracker-ep.herokuapp.com/).
